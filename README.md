## Main Result
### Waymo detection validation
![ ](./Waymoval.png)
Quantitative comparison experiments on the Waymo val set for 3D object detection. 20% of training set ( 32K) is used for
training. 
![ ](./Waymoval2.png)
Quantitative comparsion experiments on Waymo val set for 3D object detection. â€  indicates that the whole scene is divided into
four parts to accelerate SA layer. Bold texts are our results and the best results are underlined.

### ONCE detection validation

Quantitative comparison experiments on ONCE validation set. Bold texts are our results, underlined texts are the best results.
Performance indexes follow the same configurations given in [IA-SSD](https://github.com/yifanzhang713/IA-SSD)

### nuScenes detection validation
